This is a simple web-based multi-user wallet. Passwords are stored 
encrypted using a public/private keypair. This means that users can 
assign each other access to specific passwords, but neither they nor 
the administrator can gain access to information that's not been 
assigned to them.

This is a very basic system, used by a small team within the University, 
so it's not particularly pretty.
