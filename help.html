<a name="intro"><h1>Introduction</h1></a>

<p>
This system provides a secure method for storing credentials and granting
appropriate people access to them. Credentials are encrypted using <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA">public key cryptography</a> combined
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
and stored in a database. The system is designed to prevent anyone from gaining
access to credentials that haven't been explicitely granted to them, <i>even if
they have complete access to the stored data</i>. For more information about the
storage of credentials, see the <a href="#technical_details">technical details</a> 
section.

<p>
Each stored credential has one or more nominated owners, an optional expiry
period and a description stored. These can be accessed by validated users of the
system. Access, modification or granting of any stored credential itself
requires the entry of the user's wallet password each time. No sensitive
information is therefore cached, either on the server or on the client, that
could be used to gain unauthorised access to a credential, even in the case
where a user has left themselves logged into the system.

<p>
Stored credentials are free-text and any sensitive information (e.g. URLs,
security responses) can be stored, not just username/password pairs. Each
credential is stored with metadata to help users to manage and find information
within the system. This includes a description, suggested expiry time and a
flexible tagging system.

<p>
While the stored credentials are free text, a certain amount of parsing is done. 
In particular:

<ul>
<li>If a line is of the form
<pre>
Heading: value
</pre>
then it will be preceded with a "Copy" button, which will place <tt>value</tt>
onto the clipboard.
</li>
<li>If a line is of the form
<pre>
Heading TOTP: value
</pre>
then the value is assumed to be an RFC 6238 time based one-time password key. 
An extra line will be added, immediately following it, with the current OTP 
code derived from that key.
</ul>

<a name="flags"><h1>Flags</h1></a>
<p>
The "Flags" column of the View Credentials screen can contain the following 
values:
<table class="realtable">

<tr><td>O</td><td>
You are an owner of this credential
</td></tr>

<tr><td>M</td><td>
You should have access to this credential but (probably because of a
password reset) your decryption key for it is missing. This will be 
fixed automatically the next time someone with access to this credential 
accesses it.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>N</td><td>
This credential has no expiry duration specified.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>E</td><td>
This credential has an expiry duration specified and that duration has now 
passed since the credential was changed.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>I</td><td>
This credential has been marked as insecure, either because a user who had 
access to it has been deleted from the system or because an "emergency" user
has accessed it.
</td></tr>
